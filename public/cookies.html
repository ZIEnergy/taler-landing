World Foundation Cookie Policy
This Cookie Policy explains how we, the World Foundation (collectively “we”, “our”, “us” or “Foundation”), use cookies and similar technologies, like web beacons, to track the online movement of our users when they visit our websites and other Services. A web beacon is a technique used on web pages to unobtrusively (usually invisibly) allow checking that a user has accessed some content. This Cookie Policy is incorporated into and subject to the World Foundation Privacy Notice.
Depending on which of our websites (world.org, developer.world.org, and docs.world.org) you are visiting, we are using different cookies. We apply techniques of pseudonymisation to all cookies to ensure users’ privacy.
We use the following types of cookies:
Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are necessary for the Services to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you that amount to a request for services, such as logging in or filling in forms. These also include cookies we may rely on for fraud prevention. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some of the Services may not work. The legal basis for using Strictly Necessary Cookies is legitimate interest. The legitimate interest pursued is providing free information online to people who freely decide to visit that website which would not work without Strictly Necessary Cookies.
Performance/Analytics Cookies: These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Services. They help us understand page popularity and visitors’ movement around the Services. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and is therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when you have used our Services and will not be able to monitor performance. The legal basis for using Performance/Analytics Cookies is the user’s consent. Your consent can be freely withdrawn at any time.
Functionality Cookies: These cookies allow us to remember the choices you make and to tailor our Services so we can provide relevant content to you. For example, a functionality cookie can remember your preferences (e.g., country or language selection), or your username. The legal basis for using Functionality Cookies is the user’s consent. Your consent can be freely withdrawn at any time.

HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE?
The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you close your browser. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted.

You can also choose how cookies (across all websites) are handled on your device via your browser settings including blocking or deleting all cookies or just third-party cookies. Each browser manufacturer is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

Do Not Track: Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" or "DNT" signals. Since uniform standards for "DNT" signals have not been adopted, our Sites do not currently process or respond to "DNT" signals.
